## Tasks

In this document, write down what you have implemented in detail.

### 1. Create a Student Account and Update Student Information

- Users can create a student account on `create_student_account.php`.
    - This involves creating an `account` record, a `student` record, and a specific student record of `undergraduate`, `master`, or `PhD`.
    - If created successfully, the user will be redirected to `student.php`.
    - If the email has been registered, the user will be redirected to the error page.
- Users can change the password for a student account on `change_password.php`.
    - If the account does not exist or the old password does not match, the user will be redirected to the error page.


### 2. Admin Views, Creates, and Edits Sections

- Admin can view all the course sections on `section.php`.
- Admin can create a course section on `create_section.php`. If any of the following conditions is not met after the section is created, the section will not be created. After the creation, the user will be redirected back to `section.php`.
  - In the same semester, there are more than two sections associated with the same time slot.
  - In the same semester, there are more than two sections associated with the same instructor.
  - In the same semester, there would not exist two sections associated with the same classroom and time slot.
  - In the same semester, there would not exist two sections associated with the same instructor but different classrooms.
  - In the same semester, if an instructor takes two different sections, then the time slots associated with the two sections should be consecutiveâ€”the gap between two time slots is less than or equal to 15 minutes.
- Admin can edit a course section by clicking the `edit` button in the section table in `section.php`. The admin will then be navigated to `edit_section_php`, where they can edit the instructor, classroom, and time slot. A successful edition should meet all the conditions aforementioned. After the edition, the user will be redirected back to `section.php`.

  - Suggested classes will adhere to class prerequisites.
  - Classes without prerequisites can be suggested.
  - Full classes will be omitted. (15 students)
  - Failed classes will be suggested(possibly prioritized if not too difficult).
- Student can then select 1 - 3 of them and add them to their registered classes or decline the suggestion. There's a possibility that registering with this info is too complicated for this project, so the simplified version will just have a back button on the suggestion page.
 - "Suggest Classes" button on the student page that takes them to the `suggested_courses.php` page.
 - 3 suggested classes will be selectable (clickable checkbox).
 - Apply button needed to register selected classes. Ideally, it goes to the course_select.php  page with the selected courses pulled up. If it is too difficult, the button can take them to the course selection page. 
 - Back button to return student to student.php page.


### 10. Bill System

- The admin can click the `View bills` button on the dashboard page to navigate to `bills_select_semester.php`, where the admin is required to select a specific semester.

The student will then be navigated to `bill_payment.php`, where all the courses that are registered in that semester are displayed. Each credit is valued at `800` dollars. The amount that the student has to pay is equal to the total tuition minus the scholarship.
- Students can click the `Pay` button in `bill_payment.php` to pay the bill. They will be redirected to `payment_success.php`, which displays the payment success message, and then redirected to the dashboard page in five seconds.
