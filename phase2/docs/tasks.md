## Tasks

In this document, write down what you have implemented in detail.

### 1. Create Student Account and Update Student Information

- Users can create a student account on `create_student_account.php`.
    - This involves creating an `account` record, a `student` record, and a specific student record of `undergraduate`, `master`, or `PhD`.
    - If created successfully, the user will be redirected to `student.php`.
    - If the email has been registered, the user will be redirected to the error page.
- Users can change the password for a student account on `change_password.php`.
    - If the account does not exist or the old password does not match, the user will be redirected to the error page.

### 2. Admin Views, Creates, and Edits Sections

- Admin can view all the course sections on `section.php`.
- Admin can create a course section on `create_section.php`. If any of the following conditions is not met after the section being created, the section will not be created. After the creation, the user will be redirected back to `section.php`.
  - In the same semester, there are more than two sections associated with the same time slot.
  - In the same semester, there are more than two sections associated with the same instructor.
  - In the same semester, there would not exist two sections associated with the same classroom and time slot.
  - In the same semester, there would not exist two sections associated with the same instructor but different classrooms.
  - In the same semester, if an instructor takes two different sections, then the time slots associated with the two sections should be consecutiveâ€”the gap between two time slots is less than or equal to 15 minutes.
- Admin can edit a course section by clicking the `edit` button in the section table in `section.php`. The admin will then be navigated to `edit_section_php`, where they can edit the instructor, classroom, and time slot. A successful edition should meet all the conditions aforementioned. After the edition, the user will be redirected back to `section.php`.
